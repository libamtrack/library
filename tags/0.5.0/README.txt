======================

libamtrack provides computational routines for the prediction of detector response and radiobiological efficiency in heavy charged particle beams.
libamtrack is designed for research in proton and ion dosimetry and radiotherapy.
libamtrack also provides many auxiliary routines for the work with proton and ion beams.
libamtrack is a program library.
libamtrack works both under Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.
libamtrack is written in ANSI C.
libamtrack is free, open-source software under GNU GPL licence.
libamtrack is intended to facilitate the comparison of and the communication on amorphous track models for particle beam research.
