Changes in 0.5.1 (2011-08-11)
=============================

- Ability to use multiple stopping power data sources (was hard-coded PSTAR data only), in new AT_DataStoppingPower.*, both tabulated or analytical.
- Stopping power data shipped with libamtrack: PSTAR (for all predefined materials), Bethe formula (for arbitrary material), SHIELD-HIT (advanced Bethe, v10, for water only), ICRU49&73 (for water only). Further development will allow external data tables and libraries, such as libdEdx (http://sourceforge.net/projects/libdedx/).
- Reworked webGUI to cover basic ion physics for educational purposes, new categories, improved functionality
- Reworked R package compilation (including autoconf ability), now canonical source package tarball can be produced and uploaded to CRAN. Will replace providing binary distributions of R package on sf.net.
