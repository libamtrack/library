1. WHAT IS LIBAMTRACK?
======================

libamtrack provides computational routines for the prediction of detector response and radiobiological efficiency in heavy charged particle beams.
libamtrack is designed for research in proton and ion dosimetry and radiotherapy.
libamtrack also provides many auxiliary routines for the work with proton and ion beams.
libamtrack is a program library.
libamtrack works both under Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.
libamtrack is written in ANSI C.
libamtrack is free, open-source software under GNU GPL licence.
libamtrack is intended to facilitate the comparison of and the communication on amorphous track models for particle beam research.

2. HOW CAN I USE LIBAMTRACK?
============================

libamtrack as a shared library cannot be run as a single executable. A number of interfaces are already provided. You can also use libamtrack in your own code (e.g. in C, Python, Matlab, ...).

== Important ==
Please note that libamtrack (but not the web interface version) needs GSL, the GNU Scientific Library ([http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) to work.
GSL is included in most GNU/Linux distributions (you maybe have to install it via your package management system or similar). Binary installer exist for Mac OS X (http://ascend4.org/Binary_installer_for_GSL-1.13_on_Mac_OS_X) and Windows (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm). Of course, you can also compile GSL from sources yourself, also for Window using MSYS/MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/) or cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/, where a precompiled package exists.

Mac specific:
The easiest way to fetch GSL for Mac is to use MacPorts (see below, you should use the multiple architecture version: sudo port install gsl +universal). You can also compile from sources, most likely you then have to add two flags while configuring:
./configure --disable-shared --disable-dependency-tracking

i. Web-interface
----------------
The web interface covers a subset of libamtrack functions for easy access and can be found on libamtrack's website: http://libamtrack.dkfz.org. The sources can be found at (/tools/webgui). The interface development was started by Christoph Kolb within his Bachelor thesis and consolidated by Leszek Grzanka.

ii. R
-----
libamtrack is a contributed package (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/libamtrack) on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN, http://cran.r-project.org). The sources for the R package can be found at /wrapper/R/R_package. Its compilation process uses scripts found at /tools/automatic_wrapper_generator (TODO: should be 'autobindings').
There is also a more simple direct access by using the 'dyn.load' command (/wrapper/R/R_direct_access), mainly used for test scripts run on the Hudson night build system to maintain functionality during development (/test/R).

iii. Python, Matlab wrappers
--------------------
ibamtrack comes with a collection of wrappers for Python and Matlab (/wrapper/Python, /wrapper/Matlab).

iv. Use precompiled binaries
----------------------------
- Precompiled binaries (incl. headers) for your OS are found on libamtrack's website. In the future, rpm/deb packages will be provided (TODO).

v. Compile libamtrack from sources
----------------------------------
- Download the latest source release from libamtrack's website or the current development version from the svn repository (svn co https://libamtrack.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/libamtrack/trunk).
- Compilation is done via the GNU autotools tool chain (./configure && make && make install).
- More details on using GNU autotools during code development is found in /README_DEVELOPERS 
- Detailed instructions for the GNU autotools are found in /INSTALL.

-- Linux-specific:
It can be necessary to run 'ldconfig' after installation.

-- Windows-specific:
libamtrack can be build on Windows using MinGW/MSYS. Add an appropriate '--prefix=...' option for 'configure'. 
Also, an environmental variable has to be set to point to your GSL installation,
"export LIB_GSL=C:/GnuWin32" (forward slashes!). autotools package provided with MSYS doesn't cope well
with directory names that have spaces (like "Program Files"), so please install GSL, MSYS and libamtrack in
directories that doesn't have spaces or non-alphanumeric characters in names. 
 
-- Mac OS X-specific:

You may have to the architecture to your GSL installation, i.e. by
./configure --build="i386"

Mac OS X comes with rather outdated versions of the GNU autotools. To update we recommend to use MacPorts (www.macports.org), and do:
sudo port install autoconf automake libtool
Using 'Fink' (www.finkproject.org) is another possibility.

3. CAN I USE LIBAMTRACK IN MY RESEARCH AND/OR MODIFY THE CODE?
==============================================================

Everybody is welcome to read, use and modify (preferably to improve) the code according to GNU GPL 3.



4. WHERE DO I FIND DOCUMENTATION ON LIBAMTRACK?
