############################################################################################################################
0. Requirements
############################################################################################################################

The GNU Scientific Library (GSL, headers + libraries/binaries) is required for all OSs if you want to compile libamtrack 
from source (sections 1 and 8). See section 7 for installation instructions.


To compile the DISTRIBUTED SOURCES of libamtrack:       you need the GNU compiler collection gcc and other software(section 1a).
To compile the FULL DEVELOPMENT SOURCES of libamtrack,
  make releases/distributions:                          you need in addition other parts of the GNU toolchain, i.e. the GNU build 
                                                        system (autotools, i.e. automake, autoconf, and libtool, and m4),
                                                        (see sections 1b and 8). 
										  
To check out the FULL DEVELOPMENT SOURCE, you also need GIT installed.


You will find required tools depending on your OS here:

Linux
=====
The names might change depending on your distribution. For Ubuntu 14.04 LTS you need:

automake
autoconf
libtool
gcc
gfortran
libgsl0-dev

Plus for development using the Netbeans IDE
openjdk7
netbeans (which is prefereably installed in the user's home directory from the Netbeans homepage)


Using clang instead of gcc
--------------------------
If clang is installed (e.g. at /usr/bin/clang), it can be used as an alternative by exporting:
CC=/usr/bin/clang
CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
before ./configure (see 1a).


Mac OS X
========
XCode and XCode Command Line Tools (we tested with Mac OS X 10.10 Mountain Lion and XCode 6.3.2). Additional autotools
needed can be obtained by an additional package system for Mac OS X (e.g. Homebrew, Fink, MacPorts). On Fink, for example,
use the list / install command to get:
 automake(1.15), autoconf, libtool2, pkgconfig

Do not install gcc. Do also not install gfortran if you also want to compile the R package. In this case, use the gfortran
distribution from the "CRAN tools for R compilation on Mac OS X" website (s. below)


Windows
=======

MinGW/MYS
---------
MSYS from MinGW (basic POSIX shell). The MinGW DTK (developer toolkit) if you want to use autotools. The MinGW-based 
toolchain for both 32 bit and 64 bit comes with installation of Rtools (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
that is also needed when compiling R tarball source packages under Windows. Switching between 32 bit and 64 bit 
compilation is done by appropriate compiler flags ("-m32" (default) or "-m64"). See section 6 for installation instructions.
Alternatively, you can download the toolchain (http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/multilib/multi.zip) and install
manually independently from Rtools. Also, you can use other configurations of MinGW or the 64bit fork mingw-w64. In this
case you might have to use other procedures or flags (e.g. --host=i686-w64-mingw32 or x86_64-w64-mingw32 for 32/64 bit)
than the ones given in this file. We cannot of course not give any support for those alternatives - but are interested
in your experiences (s.greilich@dkfz.de).

Please make sure - for all Windows installations of MSYS, GSL, R packages, ... - NOT TO USE pathnames with spaces 
(i.e. C:\Program Files\MinGW) - that will most likely give you lots of strange errors.

mingw-w64 / MSYS2
-----------------
Alternatively, you can use the mingw-w64 fork of MinGW. From July 2015, all check of libamtrack with Windows will
use this system. It can by installed in parallel with Rtools (s. below).

Install MSYS2 as a POSIX-like console for windows:
	- Goto http://msys2.github.io/, download installer for 64bit (e.g. msys2-x86_64-YYYYMMDD.exe)
	- Execute installer (not as admin but regular user), install into c:\msys64
	- Exit and restart MSYS by calling C:\msys64\mingw64_shell.bat (it is convenient for later use to make a shortcut)
	- Do "pacman -Sy" (synchronize local package database with repos)
	- Install software needed (gcc, gdb, etc.):
		pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-libs
		pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-fortran mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc-libgfortran
		pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gdb
		pacman -S autoconf automake libtool
		pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-binutils
		pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-make
		pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gsl
		pacman -S make
		pacman -S bash
	- An overview of all tools in the toolchain can be seen by: pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
    - Optionally, you can install the same tools for 32 bit (not required): pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain	
		


############################################################################################################################
1a. Basic workflow for compilation from distributed source
############################################################################################################################

Download source distribution (e.g. from sourceforge), navigate to download directory and untar by

    tar zxvf libamtrack-x.y.tar.gz

Navigate to new directory (cd libamtrack-x.y) and execute

    ./configure
	make
	make install
	

For tweaking (target, installation directory) please see section 1b. 


############################################################################################################################
1b. Basic workflow for compilation of libamtrack from full source - using autotools
############################################################################################################################

From revision r1037 on, libamtrack follows the GNU autotool conventions to improve portability and facilitate distribution.

This requires additional files (such as configure.ac, Makefile.am, ChangeLog, NEWS, etc.) and folders (m4) to be placed 
in the subversion repository.

In addition, file and folders will be created during the autoconf/automake process (such as aclocal.m4, 
config.guess, configure, install.sh, Makefile, etc.). Those files *SHOULD NOT* be committed to the repository. 
Please refrain from doing so. 

Basic instruction on the use of GNU autotools are found in INSTALL.

The libamtrack sources can be fetched from GIT repository at github.com by:

	git clone https://github.com/libamtrack/library.git

In this way you will obtain repository with full history, all previous tags and branches.

To commit changes you did to the code please fork the repository and make a pull request.

As for section 1a, please make sure that GSL_LIB points correctly to your GSL installation (section 7) if you are working
with Windows.


Steps for compilation:
----------------------
i.   After you check out libamtrack OR 
     you updated your local workspace (which could have changed configure.ac) OR
     you changed configure.ac yourself run:

     mkdir m4
     autoreconf --force --install

     This will create a configure script plus all necessary other files.

	 
ii.  After (i.) OR
     you changed a makefile.am OR
     you want to switch between RELEASE / DEBUG (or any other) configuration
   
     ./configure                                (for an optimized, 'release' code)
     ./configure CFLAGS="-O0 -g -DDEBUG"        (for a 'debug' version of the code, e.g. to use with gdb)
     ./configure --enable-shared=no             (if you want to produce static libraries, e.g. for portable applications)

     If you use eclipse, you can simplify this step by using a separate build configurations.
   
     When using Mac OS X you might consider using multiarchtecture compilation by adding appropriate "-arch" flags (will 
	 create a single library that can be used with multiple architectures)
   
     ./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64" CPP="gcc -E"		
	 
	 which will give 32 AND 64 bit versions on Intel-based Mac, for PowerPC add "-arch ppc" (32 bit) and/or "-arch ppc64"
     	 
     You can change the default path for installation by "--prefix=/my/installation/path". The flags given in this section
	 can be used together where applicable.
   
   
iii. After (i.) OR
     (ii.) OR
     any local change in the code:
   
     make all

	 
iv.  ### TODO: Describe (and enable)

     make check >log.txt 2>&1
	 make install
	 
     make uninstall
	 make distclean
	 
	 
############################################################################################################################
1c. Non-standard make targets
############################################################################################################################

R-package
===============
Compiles an R package tarball from current libamtrack source. Works also under Windows but will skip test of package (as
multiarchtecture compilation is not (yet) set up correctly). Instead, you should use Rtools and the Windows CMD shell for 
testing and building of a binary package after running this target in MSYS2 (see below).


############################################################################################################################
2. Using an IDE
############################################################################################################################

Eclipse 3.6+ supports the autotool toolchain. There are, however, some peculiarities to be considered:

You have to manually set include path:
   Right click libamtrack project > Properties > C/C++ general > Path and Symbols
   
When using a second build configuration with debug flags (see above), eclipse gets confused and you have (TODO: fix)
to prepare debugged code to use with gbd in eclipse using the command line.

Also, Netbeans can be used.
    
	
############################################################################################################################
3. Doxygen comments
############################################################################################################################

Doxygen comments are not only used to document libamtrack's C code but they are also used during the scripted generation of
R and Python wrappers. It is essential for them to have it very carefully formatted.

- After @param[??] parameter name should go and then description.
- @param[in] defines an input, @param[out] an return parameter.
- The size of array HAS to be provided in brackets with key word "array of size". It should not be provided in function 
  declaration in the header file. Both other parameters passed to the function (see example, "n"), numbers and macro
  expansions can be used as size, also in mixed or multiple form. 
- A whitespace is needed after the first and before last bracket in the function declaration (TODO: Really? When last
  variable is an array "[]", the example below fails until the whitespace is removed for the closing bracket).
- In the function declaration there is one parameter per line, with the first parameter in the same line as function name.
- Please refrain from using "/", ";" in the description


Example:

/**
  * Returns Z for given elemental symbols
  * @param[in]   n         number of elements in arrays
  * @param[in]   acronym   elemental symbols (array of size n)
  * @param[out]  Z         corresponding Z (array of size n)
  * @return                status
  */

int AT_Z_from_element_acronym( const long n,
		char* acronym[],
		long Z[] );


############################################################################################################################
4. Build an R source package tarball
############################################################################################################################

From Jun 2014, development versions of the libamtrack R-packages are provided by R-forge: 

http://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1918

They are synchronized with the latest libamtrack sources through a night build system (Jenkins).


This workflow is replaced by the make target "R-package" (see section 1), but left here for details on the procedure 
behind that target.

The necessary files for producing an R package from libamtrack are found in:
  /distributions/R/package                     package folder structure and input files, script for compilation, hardcoded wrappers
                                           and documentation
  /tools/automatic_wrapper_generation      R scripts for automatic creation of R/C wrappers

To compile a package, follow first the instructions given in section 1b, then navigate to /wrapper/R/R_package:

Functions that should go to R package are referenced in the text file NAMESPACE. The suffix "_multi" will automatically be
skipped, as R functions are supposed to be able to work on vectors as you should always prefer the "<function_name>_multi"
version of the function over the "<function_name>_single", if possible. If "noR: " is placed in front of the function name
in NAMESPACE a C wrapper will be generated but no corresponding R wrapper. This can be useful if you want to have access 
to a function within an R function via ".C" but not a full R function on its own. 

Run ./create.package.sh 
Use --help to see options

If your function is not in resulting package, use --no-clean option and check output file "collect.doxygen.information.Rout"
for functions that fails (most likely due to faulty doxygen formatting).

The resulting package is an source tarball (libamtrack-version.tar.gz). It can either be distributed by yourself (most likely in
the case of intermediate development versions) or uploaded to CRAN (in case of an official release).

See section 8. How to make a release on how to produce binary packages.


Under Linux and Mac OS, the source package can be simply installed for use in R by typing

(sudo) R CMD INSTALL <package_name>

Under standard Windows, source tarballs cannot be installed with a common R installation.  To compile a source package 
the best way is to use the RTools (see section 0). 

Under Mac OS X, the dedicated gfortran distribution should be used (http://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/). Also,
adapt the corresponding lines in the configuration file $R_HOME/etc/makeconf, e.g.:

CC = clang -arch x86_64
CXX = clang++ -arch x86_64
CXXCPP = $(CXX) -arch x86_64 -E
FC = gfortran -arch x86_64
F77 = gfortran -arch x86_64
FLIBS =  -L/usr/local/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin8/4.2.3 -L/usr/local/lib/gcc/i686-apple-darwin8/4.2.3/x86_64 -lm
OBJC = clang -arch x86_64
OBJCXX = clang++ -arch x86_64



############################################################################################################################
5. Python wrappers
############################################################################################################################

i.   make "wrapper/Python/pyamtrack/NAMESPACE" file completely empty this will cause wrappers will be created for (almost) 
     all functions

ii.  run "python generate_Py_wrapper.py" to generate file "pyamtrack.py". The script will complain, but ignore it - some 
     functions are impossible to translate yet.

iii. copy compiled library to the same directory as "pyamtrack.py": cp ../../../src/.libs/libamtrack.so.0.0.0 libamtrack.so

iv.  run "python pyamtrack_example.py" to check sample file.


############################################################################################################################
6. Install Rtools (Windows)
############################################################################################################################

Install the latest version of Rtools from http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ with administrator priviledges. This
includes a complete multilib (32/64 bit) toolchain based on MinGW. To our knowledge this is the easiest way, even when you
intend not to compile R source packages but libamtrack only - everything is setup correctly. Since some releases, the 
toolchain directory (in "C:\Path\to\Rtools") is named "gcc-x.y.z" instead of usual "MinGW" which might be confusing first.

Make sure Windows environmental variable PATH contains:

C:\Path\to\Rtools\bin + C:\Path\to\Rtools\gcc-x.y.z\bin 

This should be autoset by Rtools installer. It is essential that the directory containing the command line tools comes 
first or second in the path: there are typically like-named tools46 in other directories, and they will not work. 


############################################################################################################################
7. Install GSL
############################################################################################################################

7a. Linux
=========
Most popular distribution offer GSL (libgsl) in their repositories. Please make sure that you install the development version 
including headers (e.g. libgsl0-dev).


7b. Mac OS X
============
Please make sure you have XCode and the XCode Command Line Tools installed (tested on Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion, Xcode tools 4.5.2, 
gcc version 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658)).

Download the latest gsl from the GNU homepage, untar (tar zxvf) and navigate into top directory of the sources.

As we want to have both 32 and 64 bit versions (Intel-based Mac) run

	./configure CC="gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64" CPP="gcc -E" --enable-shared=NO 

For PowerPC add "-arch ppc" and/or "-arch ppc64", resp. This will create single libraries that can be used with multiple architectures.

Build and check by

	make
	make check > log.txt 2>&1


then install
	
	sudo make install

gsl is now in /usr/local (or a different place if you have set an individual --prefix flag). ./gsl-config shows that path.

Alternatively, you might want to use a system like FINK or MacPorts to install gsl, but we can not give any details due to missing experience wit that.

We built static libraries, so that libamtrack will be statically link to the gsl routines and not depend on an external dynamic library, making it
package portable, i.e. the user DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE GSL installed!


7c. WINDOWS
===========

i. For regular compilation (as in section 1a, 1b, 8)
----------------------------------------------------
Install the binary package from MSYS2 (see 0)


ii. R package compilation (as for section 4, 8)
-----------------------------------------------
There are subtle differences how regular libamtrack compilation and R package compilation handle GSL and GSL pointers:

Standard Windows compilation only requires a single architecture (e.g. 32 bit if you want to be sure that your programs
run on all, including 64 bit, platforms) that goes (usually) into a standard folder structure (in /usr oder /usr/local):

bin		       - directory keeping binaries, i.e. executables and dlls
include        - include / header files
lib            - pre-/static libraries for linking
share          - other stuff

R in contrast has developed a solution to deal with multiarchitectures under Windows and thereore assumes a canonical structure of libraries 
to deal with multilibs. During R (package) compilation and also executing of R and related subprograms, the make variable R_ARCH_BIN={"i386","x64"} 
points to the current architecture, whereever necessary, i.e. using binaries and libraries but not for include: 

include       - include files (headers), common to all systems
libs/i386     - static libraries for 32 bit
libs/x64      - static libraries for 64 bit
bin/i386      - binaries for 32 bit
bin/x64       - binaries for 64 bit

It will not use "gsl-config" like regular libamtrack compilation. Since R fully supports the use of GSL, the easiest approach is therefore to 
download the dedicated pre-build libraries from the Rtools page ("localxxx.zip", http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/pub/Rtools/R215x.html) and locate 
them in a designated location in your MSYS directory (e.g. C:\Path\to\MinGW\msys\1.0\local\Rcompile\local215). 

To point to this GSL directory use the make variable 

LOCAL_SOFT

*not* GSL_LIB to point to the GSL root directory e.g. "C:/Path/to/MinGW/msys/local/Rcompile/local215" (forward slashes!). LOCAL_SOFT does not 
have to be set in the MSYS shell but in both C:\Path\to\R\etc\{i386,{x64}\Makeconf files (thanks to Uwe Ligges for his advice).

Since local215.zip contains static libraries only, the dlls in libamtrack will contain the code of gsl routines and do not depend on an external 
dynamic library, making the package portable. I.e. the user DOES NOT NEED TO HAVE GSL installed which is in accordance to R requirements.


Again, to avoid confusion and trouble we recommend to keep two installations of GSL for both purposes (i) and (ii) in two separate locations. 
Ideally, you take for (i) the precompiled file from the Rtools page, and compile the library with your toolchain for (ii) for your intended
architecture (32/64 bit) yourself.


############################################################################################################################
8.  Make a release (including R package for CRAN)
############################################################################################################################

Release
#######
- Augment "/trunk/ChangeLog", e.g. from svn logs
- Make new folder in /tags, correspoding to version to release, e.g. "0.5.4"
- Adjust "/tags/VERSION/configure.ac": AC_DEFINE(CODE_STATUS, ["Development"], [Status of the code]) --> AC_DEFINE(CODE_STATUS, ["Release"], [Status of the code])
- Adjust "/trunk/configure.ac":  
		New development number: AC_INIT([libamtrack], [0.5.5], [s.greilich@dkfz.de], [libamtrack])
		New development name:	AC_DEFINE(CODE_NAME, ["Violet Wombat"], [Cryptonym to faciliate versioning for users])
- Commit changes to SVN (this will be the release's revision number)

These steps can be skipped in case you want to make an intermediate (development) version.


Source distribution

Follow instructions given in section 4. Then run tests on tarball:
	R CMD check --as-cran libamtrack.VERSION.tar.gz, both as current as alternative user and both with latest stable and development R release (4 tests)
	Make sure to switch on "-Wall -pedantic" in ~/.R/Makevars (NOT in the package Makevars) - or similar if you are not using gcc
	
If successful, upload package tarball to ftp://CRAN.R-project.org/incoming/ using �anonymous� as log-in name and your e-mail address as password (use �ftp�).
Then send mail to CRAN@R-project.org about it with your package name and version in the subject line of the form "CRAN submission �package� �version�"
	
		
R package binaries
##################

This process is only needed for intermediate packages and mostly Windows users how do not have their system upgraded to be able to compile tarball
source packages. Release packages will be uploaded to CRAN, the R repository, where Windows and Mac binaries are automatically provided. 
Mac and Linux are furthermore able to compile source tarballs.


Linux:
------

Under Linux tarball source packages (package_x.y.z.tar.gz) can be installed directly by

R CMD INSTALL package_x.y.z.tar.gz

so binary packages should not be necessary. But if you use the --build option during this process you will get a binary package, with "--no-inst" R
will not install the package but only produce the binary.


Mac OS X:
---------

Build 32 bit or 64 bit version (skip "--no-inst" to install, too) portable binary

R CMD INSTALL --build --no-inst package_x.y.z.tar.gz
R64 CMD INSTALL  --build --no-inst package_x.y.z.tar.gz

or both in a single package
R CMD INSTALL --merge-multiarch --build --no-inst package.tar.gz

This will result in a portable .tgz file.


Windows:
--------

With Rtools installed, start Windows command shell (with administrative priviledges, i.e. 
Start button > Search programs and files > Enter "cmd" > Press "Ctrl+Shift+Enter"

Navigate to directory where the package's source tarball (created using ./create.package.sh under Linux) is located.

Now build binary package (NB: Windows environmental variable PATH has to include the R version you are using):

	R CMD INSTALL --no-inst --build package_x.y.z.tar.gz
  
The resulting zip-file can be distributed to all Windows users. They do not need to have gsl installed. 

Users can install the binary package within R by
	install.packages("C:/PATH/TO/libamtrack_x.y.zip", repos = NULL)
	
or appropriate menu short-cuts in R GUIs.

If you want to install the package yourself, just skip "--no-inst" during compilation.
