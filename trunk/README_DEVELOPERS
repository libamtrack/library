From revision r1037 on, libamtrack follow the GNU autotool conventions to improve portability and facilitate distribution.

This required new files (such as configure.ac, Makefile.am, ChangeLog, NEWS, etc.) and folders (m4) that have be placed in the subversion repository.

In addition, file and folders will be created during the autoconf/automake process (such as aclocal.m4, config.guess, configure, install.sh, Makefile, etc.). Those files *should not* be committed to the repository. Please refrain from doing so. Instead, you can trigger the autotool process and create those file in your local workspace using:

autoreconf --force --install
