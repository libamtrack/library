\chapter{Introduction}

\la{} is a library of computational routines for the prediction of solid state detector response and radiobiological effectiveness in proton and ion beams. In this field, \la{} focusses on methods that are based on widely used amorphous track models rather than for example microdosimetry models.

The \la{} project has been started with the intention to provide an open-source, freely available, and comprehensive code for the community. Written in ANSI C, it is designed to be used independent of which platform the user is working on. Furthermore, the idea behind organizing \la{} as a library is that the user can access its functionality from whatever software tools they are using, e.g. MatLab, R, S-Plus etc.
