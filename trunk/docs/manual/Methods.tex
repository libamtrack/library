\chapter{\la{} methods}

\section{Introduction}
'Methods' are the top-level routines in \la{}. From the physical parameters describing a HCP field they compute the predicted RE or RBE. In order to do so, the user has to both chose 
\begin{itemize}
\item{method independent settings, such as the RDD, ER, gamma model to be used and}
\item{method specific setting, e.g. the binning width to be used.}
\end{itemize}

Methods are implemented in the \texttt{Amtrack.c} and make use of all other subordinate routines. At the moment, four methods are available:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Grid summation method (GSM)}
\item{Ion-gamma-kill method (IGK)}
\item{Compound Poisson processes using successive convolution (CPP-SC)}
\item{Compound Poisson processes using statistical sampling (CPP-SS)}
\end{itemize}
