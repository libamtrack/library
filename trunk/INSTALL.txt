GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
====================

libamtrack was successfully built on Linux 32/64 bit (Ubuntu, openSUSE, Debian, Redhat distributions), Windows XP/Vista and Mac OS X.
If you experience trouble during installation please send a mail to s.greilich@dkfz.de; your feedback is very appreciated.


0. ALL OS
=========

i. Follow the OS specific steps given below.

ii. Use the 'make' command to compile libamtrack. The resulting binary will be stored in /lib. The binary will contain only the library routines, but not any examples etc.

iii. (Optional) In order to compile an example to check if everything is working correctly, navigate to the /example/demo and run 'make all' again (there is an additional README.txt for the example for more information). This will result in an executable.


1. LINUX
========

Requirements: 
- Packages containing gcc, makefile, gsl (+devel) have to be installed.

Edit the makefile (section 'user settings') to match your specifications:
- OS is 'Linux'.
- GSLPATH points to your GSL installation, without subdirectories like '/include' or '/lib' (most likely this is '/usr').
- MINGWPATH is Windows-specific and should be left empty.


2. WINDOWS
==========

Requirements:
- gcc for Windows is needed. Please install the port of gcc to Windows systems (http://www.mingw.org/). This will also contain 'makefile'.
- The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) is only available as unofficial Windows port (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm) but has been checked with libamtrack.

Edit the makefile (section 'user settings') to match your specifications:
- OS is 'Windows'.
- GSLPATH points to your GSL installation, without subdirectories like '\include' or '\lib' (most likely it is 'C:\Program Files\GnuWin32').
- MINGWPATH points to your MinGW installation, without subdirectories like '\include' or '\lib' (most likely it is 'C:\Program Files\MinGW').

Make sure that both libgsl.dll and libgslcblas.dll are in the same directory as the compiled code when you execute it. If these are missing, the program will not be able to run.


3. MAC OS X
===========
