\description{Currently seven predefined materials exist in libamtrack. They are referred to using sequential positive integer numbers (see also \code{\link{particle.no}}) but carry also a name, preferrably the NIST name.

When referring to a material by name, make sure that the spelling (incl. cases) is correct.}
