*** INSTALLATION FROM CRAN ***

Start R (as root, if you want) and type

'install.packages("libamtrack")'


*** INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE PACKAGE ***

To compile the libamtrack package from sources, cd to the folder where the tarball is located and type

'R CMD INSTALL <package_name>' or
'sudo R CMD INSTALL <package_name>' if you want to install using root priviledges

where <package_name> refers to the source package filename (for example 'libamtrack_0.5-1.tar.gz').


*** INSTALLATION FROM SOURCE PACKAGE ON NON-LINUX SYSTEMS ***

For Mac, please make sure to use the same architecture your GSL is built on, e.g. by

'R --arch=i386 CMD INSTALL <package_name>'

For Windows, you will have to install the Rtools (http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/) to compile source packages. Before compilation please use

'set LIB_GSL=<path/to/gsl>'

to set the environmental variable necessary. <path/to/gsl> should point to your installation directory of GSL (using forward slahes!), e.g. "c:/program files/GnuWin32" or "c:/GnuWin32"


*** REMOVING INSTALLED PACKAGE ***

To remove an installed package either use the 'remove.packages(<package_name>)' command within R or
'R CMD REMOVE <package_name>' (sudo if you used administrator right for installation)
from command-line where <package_name> refers to the package name (for example 'libamtrack').
