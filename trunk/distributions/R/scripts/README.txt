Automatic wrapper generation
############################

This is a collection of R scripts that allow the generation of wrapper functions (binding) to libamtrack.

The procedure is based on the extraction of information from doxygen comments in the source code and translation to the requirements of the language the wrapper functions are intended for.

REQUIREMENTS:
- R has to be installed. We recommend the latest version. Compiling on (>2.10.1) was successful. 
- Under Windows make sure that your R installation is included in the PATH environment variable.

USAGE:
These scripts are currently used for the wrapper functions for the R package (/wrapper/R_package) and the direct R access (/wrapper/R_direct_access) and employed by scripts from the corresponding directories. The basic workflow of all applications is however as follows:

1. The user has to specify the libamtrack function for which wrappers should be generated by specifying their names in a file 'NAMESPACE'. 'create.complete.namespace.R' browses the source code under /include and creates a 'NAMESPACE' file holding all libamtrack function. The user can then select the ones they are interested in.
2. 'collect.doxygen.information.R' browses the source code for relevant information and store it in an temporary file 'functions.sdd'.
3. After this, language specific scripts are called (filenames starting with the language name). For binding to R, e.g.:
   - 'R.generate.C.wrapper.R' and 'R.generate.R.wrapper.R' generate the C- and R-side of the bindings using 'R.type.conversion.R' to find the appropriate type castings ('double' to 'float' etc.)
   - 'R.generate.Rd.documentation' translates the doxygen information into R documentation.
